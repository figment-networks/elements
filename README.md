# Figment Elements - UI components for embeddable staking

We build Figment Elements to help you integrate staking in a matter of minutes, without the need for API integration or UI work.

## Development

After making changes to @figmentio/elements code, be sure to run `pnpm bump-version` before creating a pull request - this will guide you through the process of semantically updating the version number and creating a changelog.

Once the PR is merged in, a new version of @figmentio/elements will be automatically published to NPM.
